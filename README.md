# Geo Hunt 2.0 🔎 

Welcome to the new and improved Geo Hunt 2.0! The original [Geo Hunt](https://github.com/abbiecoghlan/geo-hunt-frontend) was made as a Javascript SPWA with a Rails API backend. Geohunt 2.0
is a new and improved version currently in progress. 


Geo Hunt 2.0 will be an interactive, location-based geography trivia game. Users will be given hints to guess a location and use the interactive map, provided by a Google Maps API, to guess and find the location. The application will also keep track of the users game stats through a dynamic leaderboard.
